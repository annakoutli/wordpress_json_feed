		<title>Simple Wordpress blog feed using json for HTML website</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This example is using a feed from a Greek Wordpress blog, but the code is prety much simple</h1>
		<p>Few lines for explaining. 'http://internetatmajor.com/blog/?json=1' link for json feed '&count=2' added to get the 2 last posts '&callback=listPosts' listPosts is the name of the function I used in the script.js file in order to get the data.</p>
		<p>Styling issues I wanted to have an avatar for every posts, I added that with css, it's not directly from the feed.</p>
		<div id="feed">
			<!-- the feed goes in here id feed is used also for markup purposes -->
		</div>
		<script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="script.js"></script>
		<script src="http://internetatmajor.com/blog/?json=1&count=2&callback=listPosts"></script>
