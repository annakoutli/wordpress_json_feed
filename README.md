wordpress_json_feed
===================

This example is using a feed from a Greek Wordpress blog http://www.internetatmajor.com/blog that apears in the down right corner of this page http://www.internetatmajor.com, but the code is prety much simple Greeks will not be an issue.

Few lines for explaining. 'http://internetatmajor.com/blog/?json=1' link for json feed '&count=2' added to get the 2 last posts '&callback=listPosts' listPosts is the name of the function I used in the script.js file in order to get the data.

Styling issues I wanted to have an avatar for every posts, I added that with css, it's not directly from the feed.
